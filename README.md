# react-snake

Hi! Thanks for getting to this repo. This is a version of the original Snake game
from the old Nokias. Feel free to peek around the code!

# My personal challenge

The goal of this project is to learn more about data structures and see what am I able to achieve with my current knoledge. This is a living project so expect updates!

The rules of this project are:

1. I can't check how other people have implemented the game
2. I can just reseach how to use javascript features and Browser APIs
